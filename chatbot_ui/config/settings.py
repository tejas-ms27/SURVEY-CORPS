"""
settings.py — Central configuration for the Survey Corps extraction pipeline.

This file is the single source of truth for every configurable value in the
entire extraction phase. All other files import constants from here instead
of hardcoding values themselves.

Why this matters: If CID Karnataka investigators need to change a threshold
(e.g., the confidence level for OCR quality), they change it in ONE place
here and the change automatically applies everywhere in the system.

# ── API Keys — THREE Groq keys, one provider (see INSTRUCTIONS.md §7) ─────────
# We deliberately use three separate Groq keys, split by phase, so each key keeps
# its own free-tier rate-limit quota and nothing throttles mid-demo:
#
#   GROQ1  → Extraction · column identification   (this phase — text model)
#   GROQ2  → Extraction · blurry-image OCR fallback (this phase — vision model)
#   GROQ3  → Analysis + report generation          (a LATER phase — NOT used here)
#
# These are read from the git-ignored .env file and are NEVER hardcoded.
# If a key is absent it is None here; the module that needs it raises a clear,
# readable error at startup via require_extraction_keys() below — it never
# crashes silently mid-run.

# Loading it in extraction code would blur the phase split the keys exist to keep.

# ── Tesseract OCR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Where is the Tesseract executable? We deliberately do NOT hardcode one machine's
# path, because a path copied from another teammate's computer (e.g. a macOS
# Homebrew path sitting in a shared .env, opened on a Windows laptop) silently
# breaks OCR and forces every scanned page onto the paid Groq Vision fallback.
# Instead we RESOLVE it at startup: an explicit TESSERACT_CMD in .env wins ONLY if
# that file actually exists on THIS machine; otherwise we look on the PATH and in
# the standard install locations for Windows / macOS / Linux. That is what lets the
# OCR "just work" on any teammate's machine without editing code or the .env.

# text key (GROQ1) so the two never compete for the same rate limit.
GROQ_VISION_MODEL = "meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"

# NOTE: There is intentionally NO Gemini model here. The locked design decision is
# "one provider only — Groq". Gemini was removed from the entire codebase.

# ── LLM Behaviour ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# We only send the first 40 lines of a document to Groq for column identification.
# Sending the full document would be expensive and unnecessary — the column
# structure is always visible in the header and first few rows.
COLUMN_ID_SAMPLE_LINES = 40

# ── Standard Output Schema ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# These are the EXACT column names that the unified output DataFrame will always
# have, regardless of what bank or file format the original statement came from.
# The analysis engine (25 fraud detection cases) depends on these exact names.
# Do not change these without also updating the analysis engine.
# Date and Time are SEPARATE columns. Date holds only the calendar date (no false
# "00:00:00"); Time holds the transaction time when the statement prints one, else
# it is blank — we never invent a midnight time.
STANDARD_COLUMNS = ["Date", "Time", "Narration", "Debit", "Credit", "Balance", "Account_ID", "Bank_Name"]

# Additional identifier columns carried ALONGSIDE the standard schema whenever a
# statement provides them: a cheque/instrument number and a transaction reference
# (Ref No / RRN / UTR / Txn ID). They are ADDITIVE — STANDARD_COLUMNS above is left
# unchanged so the analysis engine's required columns are untouched — but these
# identifiers are now preserved end-to-end (CSV + JSON) for EVERY format instead of
# being dropped just because a bank labelled the column "CHQNO" or "Ref No".
# Team decision: a cheque number and a transaction reference are DIFFERENT things in
# an investigation, so they are kept as two separate fields, never merged.
#
# Four distinct identifier concepts, each its own field (all ADDITIVE, all optional):
#   Transaction_ID        — the bank's own per-row id from a dedicated "Tran Id" column
#   Reference_Number      — the value from a dedicated "Ref No / Reference Number" column
#   Transaction_Reference — an identifier parsed OUT OF the narration text
#                           (UPI/UTR/IMPS/NEFT/RRN id embedded in "UPI/506.../NAME")
#   Cheque_Number         — a cheque/instrument number
# A statement may carry any subset; absent ones stay blank (never guessed). Keeping
# the dedicated-column reference separate from the narration-embedded one removes the
# old ambiguity where both landed in a single "Reference_Number" field.
REFERENCE_COLUMNS = ["Transaction_ID", "Reference_Number",
                     "Transaction_Reference", "Cheque_Number"]

# ── Validation Tolerances ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# we allow a small rounding error of up to 1 rupee because banks sometimes
# round interest calculations differently from simple arithmetic.

# must escalate to the LLM. Kept here (not hidden in code) so the team can tune
# them in one visible place. See CHANGES_INSTRUCTIONS.md / System Design v2.0.
#
# A parse is ACCEPTED (no LLM needed) only when, on a statement that HAS a running
# balance, at least this fraction of rows reconcile (prev ± amount = balance).
# Below this, the pipeline asks the LLM to describe the layout and re-parses.
ACCEPT_RECONCILE_RATE = 0.98
# A parse must also have captured at least this fraction of the lines that LOOK
# like transactions (parsed_rows / transaction_like_lines). A big shortfall means
# the cheap parser under-extracted, so we escalate even if the few rows reconcile.
MIN_COMPLETENESS_RATIO = 0.90
# Max number of representative lines sent to the LLM for schema discovery (Tier 4).
# The LLM only ever sees this small sample, never the whole statement.
SCHEMA_SAMPLE_LINES = 30
# When repairing rows the cheap parser could not reconcile (Tier 5), process them
# in bounded batches of this size. This replaces the old silent 40-chunk cap:
# nothing is ever dropped — any row not repaired is FLAGGED for manual review.
REPAIR_BATCH_ROWS = 60

# own collection named "transactions_{session_id}" to keep cases separate.

# ── Supported File Types ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
