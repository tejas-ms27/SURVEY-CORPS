"""
standardiser.py — Converts raw extracted content into the unified standard DataFrame.

Every bank formats their statements differently. Some call a column "Withdrawal Amt",
others call it "Debit", "W/Drl", or "Dr Amount". Some PDFs have two date columns
(Transaction Date and Value Date). Some banks show Debit and Credit as separate columns,
others show a single Amount column with the direction inferred from context.

The standardiser's job is to take the messy, bank-specific raw data and produce
one clean, consistent DataFrame with exactly these columns every time:

    Date | Narration | Debit | Credit | Balance | Account_ID | Bank_Name

TWO INPUT PATHS:
    1. TEXT-BASED (from digital PDFs, scanned PDFs, DOCX, OCR):
       The raw text is parsed line-by-line. A date-anchored regex approach extracts
       the transaction date, narration, amount, and balance from each line.
       The debit/credit split is determined by narration keywords (UPI/DR, UPI/CR)
       or balance change direction.

    2. DATAFRAME-BASED (from Excel/CSV files):
       The DataFrame already has labelled columns. The column_map from Groq tells us
       which column header corresponds to which standard field. We rename and reformat.

This module contains no API calls — it is pure Python and pandas. All the
"smart" column identification work was already done by column_identifier.py.

# ── Regex patterns for parsing transaction text lines ─────────────────────────

# Pattern to detect a date at the START of a line (the signal that a line begins a
# new transaction). Kept deliberately broad so it works across banks, not just the
# mentoring format. Matches, e.g.:
#   02/06/18, 02-06-2018, 2018-06-02   (numeric, 2- or 4-digit year)
#   3 May 2018, 16-Oct-2018, 16 Oct 18 (month-name styles)
# The OPTIONAL leading token before the date is a serial / CTR-batch / reference
# number some core-banking statements print BEFORE the date on every transaction line
# (e.g. "5114634 12-02-2020 …", "88888 13-05-2020 …", "2.3379367E7 20-08-2020 …").
# It is numeric (digits, with an optional decimal/scientific form), so a narration
# WORD before a date never matches; and the date must follow it IMMEDIATELY, so this
# only fires on the genuine reference-before-date row shape (Bug F — without it, every
# such row failed the "is this a new row?" check and got swallowed into the previous
# transaction's narration). Widened from the old 1–4 digit serial to up to ~13 chars.

# ── Document-trailer detection (generic, layout-aware) ────────────────────────

# disclaimers, legal / safety notices, contact information, an abbreviation legend,
# a restated account-identity block ("Account No :", "Statement For …"), a
# "generated on" stamp, the registered-office address, "End of Statement". None of

# glues the ENTIRE trailer onto the final transaction's narration (the "footer
# bleeding into the last transaction" defect). Per-keyword footer filters cannot
# close this gap reliably because every bank words its trailer differently.
#
# The robust, format-agnostic signal is STRUCTURAL: the transaction table ends at
# the last row that both starts with a date AND carries a money amount. The block
# after it is the trailer. We keep a genuine (short, narration-shaped) wrap of that
# final row, but cut everything from the first line that exhibits generic document-
# furniture STRUCTURE — a bullet-point notice, a URL/email, a restated identity
# "Label : value", or a closing/legend heading. The vocabulary is generic banking /
# document furniture (never a bank name), and the cut only ever applies AFTER the

    Converts raw extracted bank statement text into a standardised

    This function handles all the messy real-world formatting issues:
        - Dates in different formats (DD/MM/YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY, etc.)
        - Numbers with commas (90,000 → 90000.0)
        - Numbers with currency symbols (₹5,000 → 5000.0)
        - Empty debit or credit fields (represented as - or blank)
        - Multiple spaces between columns
        - Rows that are headers or page totals (detected and removed)
        - Narrations that contain spaces (parsed using end-of-line number extraction)

    For text-based input: uses date-anchored line parsing where each valid
    transaction line starts with a date pattern. The balance is always the
    last number, and the narration is extracted from the middle portion.

    For CSV-format text (comma-separated): parsed directly with pandas,
    then columns are renamed using the column_map.

    Parameters:
        raw_text (str): Full extracted text from any extractor.
        column_map (dict): Column structure from identify_column_structure().

# ── Header-driven column parser ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# Some statements print the columns in an order the positional (balance-from-end)
# parser cannot read — most importantly when the NARRATION column is printed LAST
# and each row begins with a transaction-id instead of a date, e.g.:
#     Tran_ID  Tran_Date  Dr_Amt  Cr_Amt  Balance  Narration
#     M3300329 06-10-2022 0       50000   50000    TRFR FROM: SUNITA KAVYA SETHI
# For these the date is not at the line start and the money columns are in the
# MIDDLE, so the positional parser yields zero rows (and the pipeline would then
# escalate to the LLM and hit token limits). When a header row is present we can
# read the column ORDER from it and parse each row by walking that order. This is
# fully bank-agnostic: it is driven entirely by the statement's own header text.

# A loose amount token for the header parser: bare integers, decimals, Indian
# commas, optional leading minus, optional CR/DR suffix. Unlike _MONEY_TOKEN this
# does NOT require a decimal part, because dedicated debit/credit columns often
# print whole-rupee amounts ("0", "50000").
