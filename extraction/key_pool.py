"""
key_pool.py — Multi-key Groq rotation, one rotating pool per ROLE (text / vision).

WHY
    Groq's daily token quota is per-MODEL-per-KEY. With a single key per role, the
    first 429 "tokens per day" error ends all further calls of that role for the run.
    With several keys per role we instead mark the exhausted key dead (for THIS run
    only — quotas reset daily, so nothing is persisted) and continue on the next key.

DESIGN (per the rotation brief)
    • Two DISJOINT pools, not one flat list: a vision-heavy stretch must not burn keys
      a later text call needs, since quota is per-model. Text calls use the text pool;
      vision calls use the vision pool.
    • Rotation is triggered ONLY by the daily-quota (429 TPD) signal the retry loops
      already detect — the detection logic is unchanged; only what happens after it
      changes (mark-dead + rotate-and-retry-once instead of immediate failure).
    • Backward compatible: with a single key in a pool this behaves EXACTLY as before
      (get_key() returns that one key; no rotation ever happens). GROQ3 is never part
      of any pool — it stays reserved for the analysis phase.

This is the single place a client is built, which also collapses the "Groq client
created in 3 files" duplication: every module asks the appropriate pool for a client.
