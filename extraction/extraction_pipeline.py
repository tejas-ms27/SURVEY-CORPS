"""
extraction_pipeline.py — Main orchestrator for the entire extraction phase.

This is the single entry point that the FastAPI backend will call when an
investigator uploads bank statement files. It coordinates all five components:

  COMPONENT 1 — Router (router.py):
      Inspects each file and determines whether it is a digital PDF, scanned
      PDF, Excel file, CSV, DOCX, or image. Returns a routing label.

  COMPONENT 2 — Extractor (extractor_*.py):
      Depending on the routing label, calls the appropriate extractor:
        - pdf_digital → extractor_digital_pdf.py → raw text string
        - pdf_scanned → extractor_ocr.py → raw text string (via Tesseract/Groq Vision)
        - image       → extractor_ocr.py → raw text string
        - excel_csv   → extractor_excel_csv.py → pandas DataFrame
        - docx        → extractor_docx.py → raw text string

  COMPONENT 3 — Column Identifier (column_identifier.py):
      Sends the first 40 lines of the extracted content to Groq (after anonymising
      all PII). Groq returns a JSON column map: which column holds the date,
      narration, debit, credit, and balance.

  COMPONENT 4 — Standardiser (standardiser.py):
      Uses the column map to convert the raw text or DataFrame into the unified
      standard schema: Date | Narration | Debit | Credit | Balance | Account_ID | Bank_Name

  COMPONENT 5 — Validator (validator.py):
      Runs three quality checks (date validity, balance arithmetic, debit/credit
      exclusivity). Splits the result into clean rows and flagged rows.

AFTER ALL FILES PROCESSED:
  - All per-file clean DataFrames are concatenated into one unified DataFrame.
  - Cross-file duplicate transactions are removed.
  - The unified clean DataFrame is ingested into ChromaDB for the RAG chatbot.

ERROR ISOLATION:
  Each file is processed inside its own try/except block. If one file crashes
  (corrupted PDF, password-protected file, unsupported format), it is added to
  the files_failed list and processing continues with the remaining files.
  The pipeline never lets one bad file crash the entire investigation.

    Main orchestrator for the extraction phase.

    Processes every uploaded file through the five-component pipeline:
        Component 1 — Route file to correct extractor
        Component 2 — Extract raw text or DataFrame (OCR records which engine ran)
        Component 3 — Identify column structure (Groq, cached, source recorded)
        Component 4 — Standardise all rows into unified schema
        Component 5 — Validate and clean, separate flagged rows

    After all files are processed:
        - Combines all per-file DataFrames into one unified DataFrame
        - Removes cross-file duplicates
        - PERSISTS clean table + flagged rows + metadata to disk (Problem 3)
        - Optionally ingests into ChromaDB (RAG phase — OFF by default here)

    Parameters:
        files (list[dict]): List of file metadata dicts, each containing:
            {"file_path": str, "account_id": str, "bank_name": str}
        session_id (str): Unique identifier for this investigation session.
        ingest_to_chromadb (bool): If True, embed the clean rows into ChromaDB.
            Default False: ChromaDB belongs to the RAG phase and downloads a model
            / does heavy work, so extraction keeps it OFF to stay bounded and not
            overheat the laptop. Turn it on only when the RAG phase needs it.
        max_ocr_pages (int): Safety cap on how many pages of a scanned PDF to OCR
            (None = all). Tests pass a small number to stay bounded.
        persist (bool): If True (default), write the run to outputs/extractions/.

    Returns:

              session_id, per_file (visibility records), and storage_paths.

      • DIGITAL PDF / DOCX: pull the text, read the account identity from the header

    Account identity (holder, number, IFSC, bank, branch...) is read ONLY from the
